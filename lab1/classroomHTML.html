    This is a big paragraph of text about Udacity. Cool. Cool. And here is an image! 
    <img src="http://udacity.github.io/fend/images/udacity.png" alt="Udacity Logo"> 
    Here's another question for you: how is the text reacting to the image?
     Is the image on its own line or is it showing up in the same last as the rest of the text?

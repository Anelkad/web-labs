            Infinity is a great idea, but unless you’re doing math, it’s mostly an idea.
    <br>
    Everything else in our world has limits. Its the limits that make it interesting, the limits that give us an edge to the box, something to leverage against.
    <br>
    Instead of denying the existence of limits and the trade-offs that they bring with them, it might be helpful to begin with an understanding of what they are, or at least what other people think they are.</p>

            Coming down the empty road, you can see the light from a ways off. It’s been green for awhile, which means it’s due to turn red soon.
            <br>
            Should you speed up, so you can make it through before the yellow appears and is gone…
            <br>
            Or should you slow down, so you can safely and gracefully come to a complete stop?
            <br>
            It depends.</p>
